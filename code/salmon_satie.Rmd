```{r, message = FALSE}
# Read in data and clean names.

salmon <- read_csv(here("data", "willamette_fish_passage.csv")) %>% 
  clean_names() %>%  
  mutate(date = mdy(date))

salmon_subset <- salmon %>% 
  select(date, coho, jack_coho, steelhead) %>% 
  mutate(coho = replace_na(coho, 0)) %>% 
  mutate(jack_coho = replace_na(jack_coho, 0)) %>% 
  mutate(steelhead = replace_na(steelhead, 0))

salmon_subset_ts <- as_tsibble(salmon_subset)

```


```{r}
steelhead <- salmon_subset_ts %>%
  filter(year(date) > 2001) %>%
  gg_season(y = steelhead, show.legend = FALSE) +
  labs(x = "Year",
       y = "Number of Steelhead")

```


```{r}
coho <- salmon_subset_ts %>%
  filter(year(date) > 2001) %>%
  gg_season(y = coho, show.legend = FALSE)  +
  labs(x = element_blank(),
       y = "Number of Coho",
       title = "Figure 1. Number of salmon in Willamette Falls Fishway")

```


```{r}
jack_coho <- salmon_subset_ts %>%
  filter(year(date) > 2001) %>%
  gg_season(y = jack_coho) +
  labs(x = element_blank(),
       y = "Number of Jack Coho")

```
```{r}
salmon_graph <- coho / jack_coho / steelhead & theme_minimal()
salmon_graph
```

Steelhead salmon migrate up the Willamette Falls Fishway between February and July, wherease Coho and Jack Coho migrate up the fishway in October. The maximum number of Coho migrating per day is much greater (more than 1000) than the maximum number of Jack Coho (~300) or Steelhead (~600). The number of Coho migrating per day have increased greately over time since 2005.
